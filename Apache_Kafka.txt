Track real time Gold prices using Apache Kafka , Pandas and MatplotLib

What is protocol ?
A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. 
Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

What is Apache Kafka ?
-How company starts :
-There is a source system and the target system
-The source system and target system exchange the data 
-Many source system and many target system , they have to exchnage data with each other 
-4S and 6T , then need to write 24 Integrations 
-Each Integration comes with difficulties around

Protocol :The Protocol has to be decided -it could be :
TCP - Transmission control Protocol  
HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol
REST - Representational State Transfer
FTP - File Transfer Protocol
JDBC - Java Database Connectivity

Data format: 
How the data should be analyzed ?
Binary,CSV,JSON,Avro 

Data schema and evolution:
How the data is shaped and may change.

Whenever the source system connected to target system , there will be increased load from connection

Kafka - A high throughput distributed messaging system.
 
Learn to handle the real time data (Essential skill for Data Engineers and Data Scientist)
Ingesting data into Spark, ingesting data into Hadoop, CQRS, replay messages, error recovery, and guaranteed distributed commit log for in-memory computing.

# First create the local host :
Start with zookeeper:
.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

Start your kafka :
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

Command to create topic in kafka:
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic TestTopic

list all the topics :
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeeper localhost:2181


# Open the topic and send the message 
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic TestTopic 


# Now check the consumer 
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic TestTopic --from-beginning
